# Data-Mining
Storing codes for mandatory course at the university - "Data Mining".

Homework 01 - Program, solving the Leaping Frogs Puzzle. The idea was to introduce us to the Depth First Search algorithm, that's why the puzzle is solved using a tree. Each state is a separate node. The stetes you can reach from that node are its children. This solution is not recomended for a lot of frogs per side (>20).

Homework 03 - Solving the 8th Queens Problem, but here it is N-th Queens Problem. Given a state of the queens, you have to find a state, that solves the puzzle. It is solved, using the Min Conflicts Method. Currently is is not very fast. I have some TODOs to finish for it.
